# LuGear

A addon for Ashita to make creating luashitacast profiles easier.

## Disclaimer

I am relatively new to creating Ashita addons. While it's functional and tested, the code might not be the best or they're areas that could be improved. I will try to fix any bugs I come across. Thank you.

## Features

- **Job-based Organization**: Organize gear sets by job
- **Gear Set Management**: Create, edit, and delete gear sets
- **Level Sync Sets**: Support for level-synced gear sets
- **Export Functionality**: Direct export to luashitacast-compatible Lua code
- **Real-time Preview**: See your gear configurations before exporting

## Usage

### Basic Commands
- `/lugear` or `/lg` - Toggle the interface

### Creating a New Set
1. Select your desired job from the dropdown
2. Click "New Set" to create a new gear set
3. Name your set and choose whether it should be level-synced
4. Use the gear grid and equipment browser to populate slots
5. Export your configuration when complete

## Dependencies

- **Item Data Module** - Should be there by default but if not then download the ashita addon lib folder and add it to your addons folder
